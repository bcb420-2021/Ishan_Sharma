AB  - Although human B cells have been extensively studied, most reports have used 
      peripheral blood as a source. Here, we used a unique tissue resource derived from 
      healthy organ donors to deeply characterize human B-cell compartments across 
      multiple tissues and donors. These datasets revealed that B cells in the blood are 
      not in homeostasis with compartments in other tissues. We found striking 
      donor-to-donor variability in the frequencies and isotype of CD27+ memory B cells 
      (MBCs). A comprehensive antibody-based screen revealed markers of MBC and allowed 
      identification of novel MBC subsets with distinct functions defined according to 
      surface expression of CD69 and CD45RB. We defined a tissue-resident MBC phenotype 
      that was predominant in the gut but absent in blood. RNA-sequencing of MBC subsets 
      from multiple tissues revealed a tissue-resident MBC gene signature as well as gut- 
      and spleen-specific signatures. Overall, these studies provide novel insights into 
      the nature and function of human B-cell compartments across multiple tissues.
